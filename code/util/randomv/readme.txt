Version 1.6

This collection generates random variables and vectors of random variables with various distributions, including Bernoulli, geometric, exponential, Gaussian, Poisson, discrete uniform, and continuous uniform, based on the parameters you input to the function.

The programs were based on C programs outlined in Probability and Random Processes
for Electrical Engineering, Second Edition, by Alberto Leon-Garcia.
